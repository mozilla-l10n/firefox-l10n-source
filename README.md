# Firefox Localization: Source

> [!NOTE]  
> We are working on migrating from our [current review system](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/documentation/products/firefox_desktop/review.html)

This repository contains the source locale messages for Firefox.
They are extracted from the active branches (Nightly, Beta, Release, ESRs)
by a scheduled [GitHub action](./.github/workflows/update.yml),
which produces pull requests that are reviewed by the L10n team before merging.

From here, messages are exposed to translators in [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/).

Note that unless otherwise specified,
files in this repository have been processed from their Source Code Form,

The Source Code Form for each such file is available from [mozilla/gecko-dev](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev).
