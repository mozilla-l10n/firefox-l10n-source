default-browser-agent-task-description = The Default Browser Agent task checks when the default changes from { -brand-short-name } to another browser. If the change happens under suspicious circumstances, it will prompt users to change back to { -brand-short-name } no more than two times.

To disable this task, update the “default-browser-agent.enabled” preference on the about:config page or the { -brand-short-name } enterprise policy setting “DisableDefaultBrowserAgent”.
